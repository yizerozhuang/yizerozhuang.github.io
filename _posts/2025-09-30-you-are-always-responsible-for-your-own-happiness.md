No one is coming to you. After all, the journey of life is depending on yourself along. It's getting harder and harder to be happy comparing to the old time, when our sign widen to a certain extent, we start to compared ourself to different people in different stages forgetting that life is more of a wilderness than a trace.
About Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence[Eternal return][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return#Friedrich_Nietzsche], I will be lying if I say I will be happy to restart my life again and again. My main reason is that the suffer of lonely and trauma is almost unbearable despiting the facts that there are happy and joy in our life as well, and I believe quite a lot of people will agree with my idea as well. So my result is that I rather rest in peace eternal than go throught this again and again.
Well I am trying to be optimistic about it, I understand being pessimistic are not gonna help me to make my life better, while that's why the topic of this blog is you are always responsiable for you own happiness
